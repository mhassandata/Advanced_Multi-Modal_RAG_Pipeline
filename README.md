# Advanced Multi-Modal RAG Pipeline

This project provides a complete, end-to-end **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook. It goes beyond standard text-based RAG by incorporating multi-modal capabilities to intelligently process and understand **text, tables, and images** from documents.

The system uses a sophisticated hybrid retrieval approach, combining keyword and semantic search, and leverages a large language model (LLM) like GPT-4o to answer complex questions with precise, page-level citations that reference the specific type of content retrieved.

## Architecture Flowchart

The entire implementation is based on the following logical flow, which handles document ingestion, processing, retrieval, and generation.

## \#\# Features

  * **üìö Multi-Modal Processing**: Ingests PDF documents and automatically extracts distinct elements like paragraphs, tables, and images using `PyMuPDF`.
  * **üëÅÔ∏è Vision Integration**: Leverages **GPT-4o** to analyze images and figures, generating rich text summaries that are embedded and used as context.
  * **üîç Hybrid Search**: Combines the strengths of keyword-based search (**BM25**) and semantic vector search (**ChromaDB**) for accurate and robust information retrieval.
  * **üíæ Open-Source Vector DB**: Uses **ChromaDB** for efficient, local storage and retrieval of document embeddings.
  * **‚úçÔ∏è Generation with Precise Citations**: Provides answers grounded in the source documents, with citations that include the page number and the type of content (e.g., `Text`, `Table`, `Image Summary`).
  * **üöÄ Interactive UI**: Includes a simple `ipywidgets` interface for easy document upload and querying directly within the notebook, simulating a user-friendly application.
  * **üõ°Ô∏è Guardrails & Logging**: Demonstrates basic MLOps principles by simulating content moderation guardrails and logging retrieval events.

## \#\# Tech Stack

  * **Core Logic**: Python 3.9+
  * **LLM & Embeddings**: OpenAI (GPT-4o, `text-embedding-3-small`)
  * **Framework**: LangChain
  * **Vector Database**: ChromaDB
  * **PDF Parsing**: PyMuPDF
  * **UI**: Jupyter Notebook with `ipywidgets`
  * **Keyword Search**: `rank-bm25`

## \#\# Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### \#\#\# 1. Prerequisites

  * Python 3.9 or higher.
  * An OpenAI API Key.

### \#\#\# 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>
```

### \#\#\# 3. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### \#\#\# 4. Install Dependencies

Create a file named `requirements.txt` and paste the following content into it.

**`requirements.txt`**:

```
openai
langchain
langchain-openai
langchain-community
langchain-text-splitters
pypdf
python-docx
pandas
Pillow
pytesseract
chromadb
rank_bm25
tiktoken
ipywidgets
PyMuPDF
```

Now, install all dependencies from the command line:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### \#\#\# 5. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project directory and add your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

The notebook is configured to load this key automatically.

## \#\# How to Use

1.  **Add Documents**: Place your PDF documents inside the `data/` directory. If the directory doesn't exist, the notebook will create it for you.
2.  **Launch Jupyter**: Open the project in your terminal and run the notebook.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "Your_RAG_Notebook_Name.ipynb"
    ```
3.  **Run the Notebook**: Execute the cells sequentially from top to bottom. The initial cells will handle setup, document processing, and building the retrieval system.
4.  **Interact with the UI**: The final cell will display an interactive UI.
      * **To Ingest New Files**: Use the "Upload Documents" button, then click "Ingest Uploaded Files".
      * **To Ask a Question**: Type your query, check/uncheck the "Enable Generation" box, and click "Run Query". The answer and its sources will be displayed below.
